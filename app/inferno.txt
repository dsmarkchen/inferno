When I had journeyed half of our life's way, 
I found my self within a shadowed forest, 
for I had lost the path that does not stray.

Ah, it is hard to speak of what it was, 
that savage forest, dense and difficult, 
which even in recall renews my fear:

so bitter -- death is hardly more severe! 
But to retell the good discovered there, 
I'll also tell the other things I saw.

I cannot clearly say how I had entered 
the wood; I was so full of sleep just at 
the point where I abandoned the true path.

But when I'd reached the bottom of a hill -- 
it rose along the boundary of the valley 
that had harrassed my heart with so much fear -- 

I looked on high and saw its shoulders clothed 
already by the rays of that same planet 
which serves to lead men straight along all roads.
  
At this my fear was somewhat quieted; 
for through the night of sorrow I had spent, 
the lake within my heart felt terror present.

And just as he who, with exhausted breath, 
having escaped from sea to short, turns back 
to watch the dangerous water he has quit,

so did my spirit, still a fugitive, 
turn back to look intently at the pass 
that never has any man survive.
  
I let my tired body rest awhile.  
Moving again, I tried the lonely slope-- 
my firm foot always was the one below. 

And almost where the hillside starts to rise-- 
look there!-- a leopard, very quick and lithe, 
a leopard covered with a spotted hide.

He did not disappear from sight, but stayed; 
indeed, he so impeded my ascent 
that I had often to turn back again.

The time was the beginning of the morning; 
the sun was rising now in fellowship 
with the same stars that had escorted it

when Divine Love first moved those things of beauty; 
so that the hour and the gentle season gave me good cause 
for hopefulness on seeing


that beast before me with his speckled skin; 
but hope was hardly able to prevent the fear I felt 
when I beheld a lion.


His head held high and ravenous with hunger--
even the air around him seemed to shudder--
this lion seemed to make his way against me.

And then a she--wolf showed herself;
she seemed to carry every craving in her leanness; 
she had already brought despair to many.


The very sight of her so weighted me
with fearfulness that I abandoned hope 
of ever climbing up that mountain slope.


Even as he who glories while he gains 
will, when the time has come to tally loss, 
lament with every thought and turn despondent,


so was I when I faced that restless beast,
which, even as she stalked me, step by step 
had thrust me back to where the sun is speechless.


While I retreated down to lower ground, 
before my eyes there suddenly appeared 
one who seemed faint because of the long silence.

When I saw him in that vast wilderness, 
"Have pity on me," were the words I cried, 
"whatever you may be--a shade, a man."


He answered me: "Not man; I once was man.
Both of my parents came from Lombardy, 
and both claimed Mantua as native city.


And I was born, though late, sub Julio,
and lived in Rome under the good Augustus-- 
the season of the false and lying gods. 

I was a poet, and I sang the righteous 
son of Anchises who had come from Troy 
when flames destroyed the pride of Ilium.

But why do you return to wretchedness?  
Why not climb up the mountain of delight, 
the origin and cause of every joy?"


"And are you then that Virgil, you the fountain 
that freely pours so rich a stream of speech?"
I answered him with shame upon my brow.


"O light and honor of all other poets, 
may my long study and the intense love 
that made me search your volume serve me now.

85 You are my master and my author, you-- 
the only one from whom my writing drew 
the noble style for which I have been honored.

88 You see the beast that made me turn aside;
help me, o famous sage, to stand against her, 
for she has made my blood and pulses shudder,"


"It is another path that you must take,"
 he answered when he saw my tearfulness,
 "if you would leave this savage wilderness; 

the beast that is the cause of your outcry 
allows no man to pass along her track, 
but blocks him even to the point of death; 

her nature is so squalid, so malicious 
that she can never sate her greedy will; 
when she has fed, she's hungrier than ever.


She mates with many living souls and shall 
yet mate with many more, until the Greyhound 
arrives, inflicting painful death on her.


That Hound will never feed on land or pewter, 
but find his fare in wisdom, love, and virtue; 
his place of birth shall be between two felts.


He will restore low-lying Italy 
for which the maid Camilla died of wounds, 
and Nisus, Turnus, and Euryalus.


And he will hunt that beast through every city
 until he thrusts her back again to Hell, 
for which she was first sent above by envy.


Therefore, I think and judge it best for you 
to follow me, and I shall guide you, taking 
you from this place through an eternal place,


where you shall hear the howls of desperation 
and see the ancient spirits in their pain, 
as each of them laments his second death;


and you shall see those souls who are content 
within the fire, for they hope to reach-- 
whenever that may be-the blessed people.


If you would then ascend as high as these, 
a soul more worthy than I am will guide you; 
I'll leave you in her care when I depart,


because that Emperor who reigns above, 
since I have been rebellious to His law, 
will not allow me entry to His city.


He governs everywhere, but rules from there; 
there is His city, His high capital: 
o happy those He chooses to be there!"


And I replied: "O poet-by that God 
whom you had never come to know-- I beg you, 
that I may flee this evil and worse evils,


to lead me to the place of which you spoke, 
that I may see the gateway of Saint Peter 
and those whom you describe as sorrowful."


Then he set out, and I moved on behind him.

The day was now departing; the dark air
released the living beings of the earth
from work and weariness; and I myself

alone prepared to undergo the battle 
both of the journeying and of the pity,
which memory, mistaking not, shall show.

O Muses, o high genius, help me now;
o memory that set down what i saw,
here shall your excellence reveal itself!

I started:"Poet, you who are my guide,
see if the force in me is strong enough
before you let me face that rugged pass.

You say that who fathered Sylvius,
while he was still corruptible, had jouneyed
into the deathless world with his live body.

For, if the Enemy of every evil
was courteous to him, considering
all he would cause and who and what he was,

that does not seem incomprehensible,
 since in the empyrean heaven he was chosen
to father honered Rome and her empire;

and if the truth be told, Rome and her realm 
were destined to become the sacred place,
the seat of the successor of great Peter.

And through the journey you ascribe to him,
he came to learn of things that were to bring
his victory and, too the papal mantle.

Later the Chosen Vessel traveled there,
to bring us back assurance of that faith
with which the way to our salvation starts.

But why should I  go there? Who sanctions it?
For I am not Aeneas, am not Paul;
nor I nor others think myself to worthy.

Therefore, if I consent to start this journey,
I fear my venture may be wild and empty.
You're wise; you know far more than what I say."

And just as he who unwills what he wills
and shifts what he intentds to seek new ends
so that he's drawn from what he had begun,

so was I in the midst of that dark land,
because, with all my thinking I annulled
the task I had so quickly undertaken.

"if I have understood what you have said," 
replied the shade of that great-hearted one,
"your soul has been assailed by cowardice." 


which often weighs so heavily on a man--
distracting him from honorable trials--
as phantoms frighten beasts when shadows fall.

That you may be dilivered from this fear,
I'll tell you why I came and what I heard
when I first felt compassion for your pain.

I was among those souls who are suspended;
a lady called to me, so blessed, so lovely
that I implored to serve at her command.

Her eyes surpasses the splendor of the star's;
and she began to speak to me-- so gentaly 
and softly -- with angelic voice. She said:

"O spirit of the courteous Mantuan,
whose fame si still a presense in the world
and shall endure as long as the world lasts,

my friend, who has not been the friend of forttune,
is hindered in his path along that lonely
hillside; he has been turned aside by terror.

From all that I have heard of him in Heaven,
he is, I fear, already so astray
that I have come to help him much too late.

Go now; with your persuative word, with all 
that is required to see that he escapes,
bring help to him, that I may bne consoled.

For I am Beatrice who send you on;
I come from where I most long to return;
Love prompted me, that Love which makes me speak.

When once again I stand before my Lord,
then I shall often let him hear your praises.'
Now Beatrice was silent. I began:

'O lady of virtue, the sole reason why 
the human race surpasses all that lies
beneath the heaven with the smallest spheres,

so welcome is your wish, that even if
it were already done, it would seem tardy
all you need do is let me now your will.

But tell me why you have not been more prudent--
descending to this center, moving from
that spacious place where you  long to return?'
