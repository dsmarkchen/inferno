Stopped mid-motion in the middle
Of what we call our life, I looked up and saw no sky--
Only a dense cage of leaf, tree, and twig. I was lost.

It's difficult to describe a forest:
Savage, arduous, extreme in its extremity. I think
And the facts come back, then the fear comes back.

Death, I believe, can only be slightly more bitter.
I can't address the good I found there
Until I describe in detail what else I saw.

I don't know for certain how I entered it--
I was so sleepy-faced
At the place where I took a wrong path.

When the wooded valley I'd just passed through
In heart-rending terror
Dead-ended at the foot of a hill,

I looked up and saw the sun bright on the body
Of the hill's high spot--like a headlight
That helps the lost find the way.

The turbulent fear that had filled my heart
During the night I had passed in such sadness
Calmed some when I saw it.

Like someone breathless after an escape
From the deep end, who stands at the side of the pool
And looks back on the danger and list of close calls,

That's how I looked back--my mind a stopped top
In the middle of a turn--for a glimpse of where I'd been,
A place no one leaves alive.

I rested for a while and then started up the sandy slope.
I lifted one well-intended foot
While the lower one acted like a post.

Suddenly, at the base of a rise, just where the hill begins
Its steep incline, I saw a leopard with a patterned coat,
Light on its feet and lightning fast.

Whereever I looked it was there, blocking the path,
So that several times I turned back
And began to retrace my steps.

It was daybreak, the sun rising with the stars
That were with it when the first clock started--
The spring wound by the hand of a love supreme

Who set in motion those beautiful things.
In spite of the beast with his showy coat
I felt hope, reassured

By the fact of morning and the hint of spring,
Although the promise hollowed
When I caught sight of nothing less than a lion.

He seemed dead set against me, head high,
Crazed with hunger. It made not just me
But even the air around him tremble.

And after him: a she-wolf, her frame so emaciated
Her body seemed defined by the cravings
That had caused so many to live in misery.

Looking at her bitch-kitty face
I felt an odd sense of solid defeat and lost sight
Of any hope of climbing higher.

You've seen the one at a roulette wheel who whispers
Sweet nothing to his winnings, but when he loses whimpers,
"How did we come to this?" and wrings his hands--

I was a sad sack like that, as the impossible beast
Inch by inch drove me back into the shadows
Where the sun keeps a stopper in its mouth.

I was rushing backward into ruin when I saw someone
Who, given I'd been alone for so long,
Seemed almost a mirage.

There on that wasteland, I called out,
"Take pity on me, please, whatever you are,
Ghost or material man."  

"I was once a man." he said, "but now I'm not.
Both my parents, both Lombardi,
Were born in Mantua.

I was born late in the day of Julius Caesar
And lived in Rome, under the reign of good Augustus,
Back when the gods were false and told sweet-talking lies.

I was a poet. I sang the song of the righteous son
Of Anchises, who come back by boat from Troy
After smug Ilium had been burned to black ash.

But you, why return to what made you unhappy?
Why not climb the meringue-pie mountain ahead of you?
It's the ultimate end, and means of all pleasure."

I said, "You're Virgil, aren't you? You're the rainmaker
Who creates a torrent of speech that turns into a riptide."
Then I felt bashful and hung my head.

"The best and the brightest in the class of poets,
I read you and loved you and hope
That what I learned from you will now serve me well.

First of all authors and master of me,
I borrowed from you and to you I owe a debt
For the music that's brought me success.

Can you see the beast I had to flee? Can you save me
From her? You, Mr Ubermensch, you Mr. Man
Of the World. I'm shaking with fear."

When he saw that I was now in tears, he said,
"In that case, you have to take a different route
to escape this place that is only rock and the sandy road.

The beast that drove you back and made you cry
Ends the life of any who try
To pass here on their way through.

She's insane and insatiable. She eats more and that
Just makes her more malignant with craving. She kills
All she comes in contact with. All with whom she comes.

She takes many to her bed
And many more are coming, until the day
The big dog arrives and deals her an agonizing death.

The dog doesn't need property or money but lives
On knowledge, love and truth.
He'll be born between two layers of felt.

He'll be the savior of a now-humbled country
For which the gallant Camilla
And three loyal boys died of their wounds.


He'll search for her in this city and that, chasing the bitch
Back to the hole where Envy first undid her chain
And choker and set her loose.

As we go forward from here, it's best if you stay behind me;
I'll play the part of your guide. It's my plan
To lead you through a place neverending, ie, eternal

Hell, where you'll hear the worst kind of wailing,
See the ageless shades writhing in pain,
Sense their vain request for a second death.

After that, you'll see those who are happy in the heat
Of the fire because they hope at some point to pursue
The path to Purgatory and so achieve a Bible clerk's bliss;

To those, if that's where you would go, up and farther up,
You'll need another escort, one more honored
Than I. When I leave you, I'll leave you with her.

The Emperor on high says I can't enter His city;
I wasn't obedient to His unbendable laws. He says
I'm smudged by Adam's ink and so must live in Limbo.

He reigns in all parts of the empire. His city is there;
So is His chair, poised at the edge of Heaven.
Happy are those He asks in."

And I said to him, "Poet, I beg of you,
By the God you never knew, help me out of this Denmark,
Which threatens to go from bad to worse. Lead me

To where you just mentioned, so I can see the door
Of Purgatory and meet Saint Peter at the Gate and,
Along the way, see the dolorous souls who are designated

Damned." Then he set out, and I at his back.

So, the brownout evening and the dark air
Let go the sleepy earthly animals,
And I alone

Got ready for the combat, both with the path
And also with the weeping,
Which my uneasy memory unerringly remembers.

Muse and past intelligence, help me;
Memory that wrote everything down
In synapic ink, prove your perfect worth.

I began with, "Poet, first look through this pane of glass
That is my mind and decide whether I'm fit
Before you commit me to this difficult task."

I said, "You wrote that the father of Silvius
Went alive to Hell and with his mortal flesh
Felt the heat and cold.

I understand the rival of evil let him in--
It only makes sense since he was who he was.
And because of what was meant to happen after,

It seems right, since he knew he'd been chosen
In the highest reaches of Heaven to be the father
Of imperial Rome and her holy domination--

Which would, to abandon fiction
And turn to truth, combine together to form
The holy seat of Peter and his successors.

As you described, when he took this trip
he learned all the needed to know to conquer Turnus
And put in place the pontifical future.

Later on, God's chosen proxy, Paul, was caught up
And returned to confirm that faith
Is Step One on the way to salvation.

But why must I go there? Who says, and what army?
I'm nothing, I am nobody. Not I,
Nor any, think I'm Paul or Aeneas and suited for this.

Say I say okay, and descend, what then?
Je suis fou. I am crazy, you are not.
You must know this: what it is to doubt."

As one who revises his idea of what he wants,
Thinking, On second thought --
Then abandoning whatever he'd embarked upon--

I stood like that on that clouded-over slope,
Rumination unraveling my resolve,
Until I gave up what I'd instinctively begun.

"If I understand you,"
Said the brave shade,
"Your character's been struck by cowardice.

Not an uncommon occurrence. It makes even
The well-intended scurry like an animal
Who sees a monster in the margin of his nightmare.

I'll try to free you from your fear
By telling you why I'm here and what it was I heard
That tore my heart in two.

I was suspended with the others when a woman called me
Who was so convincing that I said
She could tell me what to do and I would do it.

Her eyes were like a star at night is bright. If angels could,
They would sing something that would sound
Like what she said:'Famous man and Mantuan,

Famous until time's whimpering end,
My friend is almost dead.
He's already on a slippery wasted slope.

A bar here, a barricade there.
He has no hope.
From what I've heard, he never faces forward;

One only sees him tracking back. Even now, as fate
Falls through its pie-shaped mesh of tick and liquid hour,
He may be too far gone. I may have come too late.

So hurry and with that way of yours with words
And with whatever else you need,
Save him and solace me.

I'm Beatrice and begging you to go. I want nothing more
Than to go back to where I came from.
Love moves me and makes me speak.

Forever after this, I'll let Him on high know
How much I owe you, how kind you've been.'
Then silence, until I said,

'Willful Woman--Because "pure of heart is to will
One thing"-- only through you can humans exceed
The limits of Heaven's little lunar circle.

I'm so happy to do what you wish that it only remains
For you to tell me what it is. Even if I'd already done it,
I would still fell I'd taken too long.

But tell me, how is it you're here in this infernal place
So far from where you love to sit and bit by bit
Piece your days together like a boundless Cornell box?'

'Since you seem sincere and so want to know,' 
She said, 'I'll say, but I'll be brief.
It's this: I am afraid of nothing in this pit.

What can hurt me here? What should I fear?
What beast can do me in that doesn't live within?
One shouldn't fear what isn't.

I'm made, by nature and nurture, and mercifully
I am who I am and thus, I don't feel
The flames of hell down here.

There's a heavenly someone, a woman so moved
By his difficulties here below, she dared to break
With judgment above and let me send you to him.

It's she who summoned Lucy and said,
"Listen, there's someone who needs you now--
And you who know no cruelty--

I'm entrusting him to your care."
Lucy looked and found me sitting
At the side of ancient Rachel.

She said, "Don't you hear him?
Don't you know he's weeping in the dark?
Don't you owe him anything

Who loved you so? Don't you see death
Threatening him with a flood
That has no vaulted ocean overhead?"

Once I heard those words I ran
As fast as one can run--Whether into the arms of good
Or away from the arms of harm--

From on high, where I was, to this rusted netherworld
To put my trust in you whose honorable words
Bring equal honor to those who listen to them.'

She spoke and when she finished
Her eyes, bright with tears, met mine;
Her weeping only made me want to act faster.

And just so, just as she wished,
I came to you on this exquisite mountain,
On the short path, and momentarily barred

The beast that blocked your way. What is this then?
Why? Why hang back? Why keep a coward
In the cupboard of your heart? Why not be bold and dare,

When up there three women in the courtyard of Heaven
Care for you. And don't you see? I am telling you
In no uncertain terms, I'm here to help you."

Like those delicate flowers that bend their closed heads
In the killing cold of night, and at daybreak look up
And see the sun, and open,

So I felt myself comeback to life
Like a man on death row to whom it's been said,
"Sorry, we made a terrible error. You're free now."

I said, "How kind she was to help me,
How gracious you were to respond so quickly
To the truth of what she told you.

You're very eloquent. After hearing you speak,
I feel eager to go on.
The initial scheme now seems feasible again.

Let's go, since we're both of one mind:
You'll be my tutor, docent, doctor."
That's what I said to him and then he moved and

I entered the dark wood, the crushing way.
